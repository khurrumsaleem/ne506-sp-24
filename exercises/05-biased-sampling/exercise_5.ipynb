    "# In-class Exercise #5: Biased Random Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "In past exercises, we have focused on random sampling from non-physical PDFs (i.e., the PDF data did not represent physical processes). In our previous Jupyter notebooks we have (1) produced many samples, and (2) demonstrated that our sampling strategy reproduced the original PDF over those many samples.  In today's exercise, we will review random sampling and apply those methods to a radiation transport example by hand (without using Python)\n",
